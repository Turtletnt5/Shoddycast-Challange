Submission for Challenge: beat Austin's python code that took 8 days to run 1 billion sample dice rolls documenting the number of 1's achieved in a 4-sided die rolled 231 times.

This Utilizes threads to split the work load for maximum preformance.


In the main file you will find two const variables one for the total rolls and one for the number of total threads

For maximum performance set maximum threads to your processor maximum threads, 
you can check task manager and in performance tab under CPU look for logical processors and that should be your maximum threads
